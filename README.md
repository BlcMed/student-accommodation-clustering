# Student Accommodation Clustering Project

This project aims to help students find the best accommodation by clustering accommodations based on their amenities, budget, and proximity to preferred locations.

## Overview

In this project, we utilize data analysis and machine learning techniques to classify accommodations and suggest suitable options for students based on their preferences. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/BlcMed/student-housing-clustering.git
```

1. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd student-housing-clustering
```

3. Set up a Python virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Setup API Keys:**
- Rename `.env.sample` to `.env`.
- Add your FOURSQUARE_API_KEY to the `.env` file.

2. **Run Jupyter notebooks:**

- Execute the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory in sequential order.

- Follow the instructions in each notebook to perform data analysis, clustering, and visualization.
